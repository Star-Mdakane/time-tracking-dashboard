## My process
The steps which I will attempt to take:
The profile is a constant div which means I will create it via html.
For the other divs I will attempt to to inject the the static elements like the image, and title.
Next I will attempt to populate the rest using some if statements, making the timeframes buttons then controlling what is required.

Problems encountered:
Border radius of my li. Somehow I seperated the li element from its class ad were styted differently causing it to behave strange and have margins or gap at the bottom which I could not reach.
The profile list item on span of 2 rows would stretch the list items on that row on 2 columns or more.
For selecting the timeframes, I tried making it self change and after a day I remembered that I forgot to use my buttons.
After that I tried to make the value of a property dynamic which held me back days but when I tried hardcoding it I saw that it worked and I was comparing values to later realise thst it works...that's how exhausting this project was.
